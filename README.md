I am a results-driven Full Stack Developer with a strong background in developing and maintaining web applications across a variety of industries. With a solid foundation in front-end and back-end technologies, I specialize in building dynamic, responsive user interfaces using ReactJS and creating scalable, robust REST APIs. I am also proficient in modern development frameworks such as Express, NodeJS, and Electron.js, and have experience with both relational and NoSQL databases.

In my current role as a Senior Software Engineer at Hottinger, Bruel & Kjaer Engineering Solutions, I lead UI/UX design efforts and contribute to a wide range of technical projects, from data validation systems to ETL processes. I work closely with cross-functional teams in an Agile environment to deliver high-quality solutions and ensure seamless integration with existing systems.

I have a strong foundation in both full-stack development and systems modernization, with a particular focus on streamlining legacy applications and automating processes. My expertise also extends to software troubleshooting, client support, and version control using Git and GitLab.

Earlier in my career, I gained valuable experience as a Software Developer at Franklin Corporation, where I modernized legacy systems and improved automation for production applications. Prior to transitioning to software development, I worked as a commercial photographer and graphic designer, which honed my eye for design and attention to detail.

I hold a Bachelor’s degree in Applied Science in Information Systems from Mississippi University for Women, where I graduated Cum Laude. Additionally, I have an Associate’s degree in Information Systems from Itawamba Community College, where I was a member of the Phi Theta Kappa Honor Society.

With a passion for technology and a commitment to continuous learning, I am always looking for opportunities to grow and contribute to impactful projects.
